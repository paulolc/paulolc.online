[Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/) ([HN I](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20381027), [HN II](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20341354))

Developers with visual impairment have different needs regarding indentation. One could need a tab-width of 1 due to the use of gigantic font size and the other a tab-with of 8 because of a wide monitor.
